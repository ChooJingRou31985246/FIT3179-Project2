                  A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a
                  single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should 
                  be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions 
                  of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp 
                  its main points.
